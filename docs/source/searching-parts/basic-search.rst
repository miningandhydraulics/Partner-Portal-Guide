Basic Search
============

The basic search interface is your primary tool for finding parts in the MHS Partner Portal. This guide covers the three main search types and how to use them effectively.

Accessing the Search Interface
------------------------------

To start searching for parts:

1. **Click "Part Enquiry"** in the main navigation
2. Or **use the search box** on your dashboard
3. Or **click "Search parts"** from quick actions

The search interface includes:

Search Types
------------

The portal offers three distinct search methods:

Exact Part Number Search
------------------------

**When to use:** When you know the complete, exact part number.

**How it works:**
1. **Select "Exact Part Number"** from the dropdown
2. **Enter the complete part number** (e.g., "HYD-123-456")
3. **Click Search** or press Enter

**What you get:**
- Complete part information and specifications
- Real-time stock levels
- Pricing specific to your account
- Technical documentation
- Related parts and alternatives

**Custom Part Number Support:**
If you've set up custom part number mappings, you can search using your internal part numbers. The system will:
- Automatically convert to MHS part numbers
- Show a notification about the conversion
- Display both your part number and the MHS equivalent

**Cross-Reference Handling:**
If you search for an alternative or legacy part number:
- The system shows available cross-references
- Displays both old and current part information
- Provides links to search for current parts

Fuzzy Part Number Search
------------------------

**When to use:** When you're not sure of the exact part number or want to find similar parts.

**How it works:**
1. **Select "Fuzzy Part Number"** from the dropdown
2. **Enter a partial or approximate part number** (e.g., "HYD-123")
3. **Click Search**

**What you get:**
- Multiple results matching your criteria
- Parts with similar part numbers
- Ranked by relevance to your search term

**Tips for fuzzy search:**
- Use key portions of the part number
- Include hyphens and spaces as they appear
- Try different combinations if you don't find what you need

Description Search
------------------

**When to use:** When you know what the part does but not the part number.

**How it works:**
1. **Select "Description"** from the dropdown
2. **Enter keywords describing the part** (e.g., "hydraulic pump seal")
3. **Click Search**

**What you get:**
- Parts matching your description keywords
- Sorted by relevance
- Multiple product categories

**Description search tips:**
- Use specific technical terms when possible
- Include key specifications (size, pressure, etc.)
- Try both generic and brand-specific terms
- Use multiple keywords for better results

Auto-Complete Feature
---------------------

As you type in the search box, the auto-complete feature provides:

**Smart Suggestions:**
