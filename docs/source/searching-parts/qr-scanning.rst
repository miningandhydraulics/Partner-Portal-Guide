Basic Scanning Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the QR scanner
2. Point your camera at the QR code or barcode
3. Hold steady until the code is recognized
4. Wait for automatic search to complete

**Scanning Tips:**
- **Hold the device steady** for 2-3 seconds
- **Ensure the entire code** is visible in the frame
- **Move closer or farther** if the code isn't focusing
- **Use good lighting** for better recognition
- **Clean the camera lens** if scanning is difficult

**What Happens After Scanning:**
- The part number is automatically extracted
- An exact part search is performed
- Results are displayed just like a manual search
- You can immediately add items to your cart

Supported Code Types
--------------------

The scanner recognizes:

**QR Codes:**
- Standard QR codes containing part numbers
- Data Matrix codes
- Custom QR codes with part information

**Barcodes:**
- UPC barcodes
- Code 128 barcodes

- Most common industrial barcode formats

**Part Number Formats:**
- Plain text part numbers
- JSON formatted data
- URL-encoded part information

Using QR Scanning Effectively
------------------------------

In the Warehouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Scan parts directly from shelves or bins
2. Verify part numbers before ordering
3. Check stock levels instantly
4. Add to cart for immediate ordering

For Inventory Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Scan multiple items quickly
- Build orders efficiently using mobile device
- Verify part authenticity against your records

For Reordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Scan empty packaging to reorder parts
- Use QR codes from previous orders or invoices
- Quick lookup for maintenance schedules

Troubleshooting QR Scanning
----------------------------

**Scanner Won't Start:**
- **Check camera permissions** in browser settings
- **Refresh the page** and try again
- **Try a different browser** if issues persist
- **Ensure you're using HTTPS** (required for camera access)

**Can't Scan Codes:**
- **Clean the camera lens** 
- **Improve lighting** conditions
- **Hold device steadier**
- **Try different angles** or distances
- **Check if the code is damaged** or unclear

**Wrong Part Found:**
- **Verify the QR code** contains the correct information
- **Check for custom part number mappings**
- **Use manual search** as a backup
- **Contact support** if codes consistently fail

**Mobile-Specific Issues:**
- **Update your browser** to the latest version
- **Clear browser cache** and try again
- **Check mobile data/WiFi** connection
- **Try switching between front/back cameras**

QR Scanning Best Practices
---------------------------

**For Best Results:**
- **Use in good lighting** conditions
- **Hold the device steady** while scanning
- **Keep QR codes clean** and undamaged
- **Scan at appropriate distance** (usually 6-12 inches)

**Warehouse Efficiency:**
- **Train staff** on proper scanning techniques
- **Maintain QR code quality** on shelving and bins
- **Use mobile devices** with good cameras
- **Create standardized QR codes** for frequently ordered parts

**Security Considerations:**
- **Only scan trusted QR codes**
- **Verify part information** after scanning
- **Be cautious** with QR codes from unknown sources

Mobile Scanning Tips
---------------------

**Device Orientation:**
- **Portrait mode** usually works best
- **Landscape mode** for wide barcodes
- **Auto-rotation** can help with difficult angles

**Camera Quality:**
- **Higher resolution cameras** scan more reliably
- **Auto-focus features** improve accuracy
- **Good lighting** is more important than camera quality

**Battery Management:**
- **Camera usage** can drain battery quickly
- **Close scanner** when not in use
- **Use power-saving mode** if available

Creating QR Codes for Your Business
------------------------------------

You can create your own QR codes for frequently ordered parts:

**QR Code Content:**
- **Simple part numbers** work best
- **Avoid special characters** that might cause issues
- **Test codes** before printing in bulk

**QR Code Tools:**
- **Free online generators** are available
- **Include part number only** for simplest scanning
- **Test with the portal scanner** before deployment

**Physical Implementation:**
- **Print on durable materials** for warehouse use
- **Size appropriately** for scanning distance
- **Include human-readable text** as backup
