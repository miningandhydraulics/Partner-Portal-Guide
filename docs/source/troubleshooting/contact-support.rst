   Subject: [ABC Company] - Bulk upload failing with validation errors
   
   Dear MHS Support,
   
   I'm having trouble with the bulk upload feature when trying to upload 
   a 200-item order for our monthly maintenance.
   
   Issue Details:
   - Trying to upload Excel file with part numbers and quantities
   - Getting "Invalid part number" errors for parts I know exist
   - Have tried CSV format as well
   - Error occurs on approximately 50% of parts
   
   What I've tried:
   - Checked part number spelling
   - Tried smaller file size (50 items)
   - Cleared browser cache
   - Tried different browser (Chrome and Firefox)
   
   System info:
   - Browser: Chrome Version 96
   - OS: Windows 10
   - File format: Excel .xlsx
   
   This is affecting our maintenance schedule. Can you help resolve this?
