   a 200-item order for our monthly maintenance.
   
   Issue Details:
   - Trying to upload Excel file with part numbers and quantities
   - Getting "Invalid part number" errors for parts I know exist
   - Have tried CSV format as well
   - Error occurs on approximately 50% of parts
   
   What I've tried:

   This is affecting our maintenance schedule. Can you help resolve this?
